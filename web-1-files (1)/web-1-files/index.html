    <!-- First Half of Story Text -->
    <p>The U.S. House Committee on Ethics is deadlocked on whether to release its report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose nomination to serve as President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general has been plagued by controversy.</p>

    <p>After meeting behind closed doors for about two hours Wednesday, panel Chair Michael Guest, R-Miss., told reporters "there was not an agreement by the committee to release the report."</p>

    <p>Ranking Member Susan Wild, D-Pa., said shortly after that there was "no consensus" on the issue, and that the committee will revisit the matter in a meeting on Dec. 5.</p>

    <p>"I will say that a vote was taken," Wild said. "As many of you know, this committee is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans — five Dems, five Republicans — which means that in order to affirmatively move something forward, somebody has to cross party lines and vote with the other side ... that did not happen in today's vote."</p>

    <p>The highly anticipated report is the culmination of a probe into allegations that Gaetz participated in sex parties, used illegal drugs and had sex with a minor. The FBI investigated similar allegations beginning in 2021, but the Department of Justice did not bring charges.</p>

    <p>Gaetz, a conservative firebrand from Florida and a loyal Trump defender, resigned his seat before the panel voted on the report, and insists he did nothing wrong.</p>

    <p>Gaetz himself was on Capitol Hill Wednesday meeting with the Senate Republicans who likely will determine his fate as Trump's nominee to lead the DOJ. Several have said they want to see the ethics report as part of Gaetz's confirmation process, but have generally treaded cautiously about his nomination. Some publicly say he faces an uphill battle and will have to answer tough questions through the confirmation process.</p>

    <p>Texas Sen. John Cornyn — who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would take up the nomination — told reporters he wanted to see the full record about Gaetz, and expected details of the ethics report would come out in some form. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the judiciary chair, sent a letter to the House panel requesting the report and records of the investigation be turned over immediately to the Senate committee.</p>

    <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., warned that releasing the report violated the panel's practice of not publicly revealing any information about probes of lawmakers who were no longer House members, saying it would open "Pandora's box."</p>

    <p>But ethics Chair Guest previously told NPR that the speaker "will not be influencing the decision of the committee. We will reach an independent decision as a committee when we meet."</p>

    <!-- Remaining Story Text -->
    <p>The issue has been a point of contention, especially with Gaetz's close connections to several high-profile political figures, both within and outside of Congress. As part of the investigation, the committee is reviewing communications and records that may reveal further ties to key political figures.</p>

    <p>As this investigation unfolds, the political world remains on edge, with many waiting to see if Gaetz’s actions will lead to broader political consequences. Political analysts suggest that these developments could affect not only Gaetz’s future but also the direction of the GOP in the years to come.</p>

    <p>At present, Gaetz remains in office, continuing his duties while the investigation progresses. The public and political responses will likely shape the future of the inquiry, especially as new information continues to surface. NPR will continue to monitor and report on these events as they unfold.</p>
